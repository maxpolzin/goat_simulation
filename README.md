# Robotic Locomotion through Active and Passive Morphological Adaptation

This repository contains the simulation software for the robot developed in the paper **"Robotic Locomotion through Active and Passive Morphological Adaptation in Extreme Outdoor Environments"**. 
The robot showcases active morphological reconfiguration to navigate complex terrains with multi-modal locomotion, including driving, rolling, and swimming.

Main repo is located [here](https://github.com/maxpolzin/goat).
